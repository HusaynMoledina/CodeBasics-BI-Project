# Power BI Business Dashboard Project

This repository contains a Power BI project guided by Codebasics. The project is designed to offer comprehensive insights across various business dimensions, helping organizations make informed decisions. The dashboard is divided into five key views: Finance, Sales, Marketing, Supply Chain, and Executive.

## Views Overview

### 1. Finance View
The Finance view provides a detailed Profit & Loss (P&L) statement. It allows you to analyze financial performance by customer, product, country, or any aggregation of these. The analysis can be done over any selected time period, offering flexibility and depth in financial reporting.

### 2. Sales View
The Sales view focuses on customer performance analysis. It provides key metrics such as Net Sales and Gross Margin, allowing you to view these in profitability and growth matrices. This view helps in understanding the sales trends and identifying areas of improvement.

### 3. Marketing View
The Marketing view offers a comprehensive analysis of product performance. Similar to the Sales view, it provides key metrics like Net Sales and Gross Margin, with an emphasis on profitability and growth. This view is essential for evaluating the effectiveness of marketing strategies.

### 4. Supply Chain View
The Supply Chain view is designed to optimize supply chain operations. It provides metrics such as Forecast Accuracy, Net Error, and risk profiles for different products, segments, categories, and customers. This view is crucial for maintaining efficient and reliable supply chain processes.

### 5. Executive View
The Executive view serves as a top-level dashboard, consolidating key insights from all other views. It provides a high-level overview for executives, enabling quick decision-making by presenting the most critical metrics across all dimensions of the business.
